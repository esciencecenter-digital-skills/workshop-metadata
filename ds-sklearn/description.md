This hands-on workshop will provide you with the basics of machine learning using Python.

Machine learning is the field devoted to methods and algorithms that 'learn' from data.
It can be applied to a vast range of different domains, from linguistics to physics and from medical imaging to history.

This workshop covers the basics of machine learning in a practical and hands-on manner.
It does not focus on specific types of machine learning models. 
Instead, the goal is that upon completing the workshop, you will be able to build your own machine 
learning pipeline from start to end.


We start with data exploration and prepare the data so that it is suitable for machine learning.
We learn how to train a model on the data using scikit-learn.
We learn how to select the best model from the trained models. 
We learn how the model's performance depends on its flexibility and the size 
of the training data set.
Finally, we learn how to optimize a model's hyperparameters.
