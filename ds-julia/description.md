The Julia programming language is getting more and more popular as a language for data analysis, modelling and optimization problems. It promises the ease of Python or R with a run-time efficiency closer to C or Fortran. Julia also is a more modern language with a packaging ecosystem that makes packages easier to install and maintain. A programmer that is familiar with Python, R or Matlab should have little problem getting up to speed with the basics of Julia. However, to really obtain the promised near native run-time efficiency is a different skill altogether.

This workshop aims to get research software engineers (experienced in another programming language) from their first steps in Julia to become aware of all the major techniques and pitfalls when it comes to writing performant Julia.

We will work hands-on with real-world examples to explore concepts in the Julia language, focussing on differences with other languages. After the first day, you will be familiar with the basic constructs of the language, some popular libraries, and its package manager, including unit testing and documentation.

The second day we will dive deeper in making Julia code fast to run. We'll see how to benchmark and profile code, and find out what is fast and slow. This means getting to grips with Julia's type system and its compilation strategy. We will close the day with parallel programming and using the GPU to make our code even faster.
