Learners are expected to have the following knowledge:
- Basic Python programming skills and familiarity with the Pandas package.
- Basic knowledge on machine learning, including the following concepts: Data cleaning, train & test split, type of problems (regression, classification), overfitting & underfitting, metrics (accuracy, recall, etc.).

Please take [this one-minute quiz](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=zOo6qgdjskKsBXh91cMldBo0Sr0r9LlAky4oLGSYS6RUMElCSVkzVjBSVlQ2SUJJWFFUU1o1OFVUVy4u), if you answered "No" to most of the questions, this workshop may be too advanced for you, and you may want to consider signing up in the future when you have the prerequired knowledge. You could consider following [a data carpentry workshop](https://datacarpentry.github.io/python-ecology-lesson/) to learn about data preprocessing and/or [learn more about machine learning in this course](https://inria.github.io/scikit-learn-mooc/). Check [our upcoming workshops](https://www.esciencecenter.nl/events/?f=workshops) for upcoming courses on these topics. Please contact training@esciencecenter.nl if you have any questions about the prerequisites or course content.

Note that this workshop is an introduction into deep learning targeted to researchers who want to **apply** deep learning. 
If you are already familiar with the concepts in the syllabus 
then a more advanced course might be better suited for your interests!
If you are looking for a more advanced course that is geared towards AI researchers 
and also covers running deep learning models on High-Performance Computing (HPC) infrastructures,
checkout [upcoming editions](https://www.surf.nl/en/agenda) of the [Introduction to Deep Learning workshop hosted by SURF](https://github.com/sara-nl/HPML-course-materials).
