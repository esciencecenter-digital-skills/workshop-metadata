This workshop gives an introduction to deep learning for researchers who are familiar with the basics of (non-deep) machine learning. You will learn how to prepare data for deep learning, implement a basic deep learning model in Python with Keras, monitor and troubleshoot the training process and implement different layer types, such as convolutional layers.
