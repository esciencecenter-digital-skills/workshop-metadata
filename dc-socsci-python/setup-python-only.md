In order to participate in this workshop, you need to have Python installed.

[Please follow the instructions here](https://datacarpentry.github.io/python-socialsci/#setup-instructions-for-python)

Alternatively, there are several ways of installing Python on your system without Anaconda.
  - If you have no fear of the command line, we recommend installing the latest stable version of Python from [python.org/downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  - Take a look at Spyder if you like an integrated development environment similar to RStudio.
