Create more impact with your software! Bring your own code and let us show you how you can make your project reusable. Learn how to use GitHub, how to write good documentation and apply the right best practices. You will enable not only others to use your code, but also yourself in the future. Your reusable code will make your research reproducible and lead to better science by yourself and your peers. Join us for this one-day workshop and polish your software into the shining gem it deserves to be.
