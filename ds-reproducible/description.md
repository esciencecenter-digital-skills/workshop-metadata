Reproducible research is the foundation of science. This workshop is tailored for PhD candidates and Research Software Engineers affiliated with Dutch research institutions who would like to learn more about how to apply best practices to make your research reproducible through reusable code.

The workshop will cover the following key aspects:

- Why is reproducibility important?
- How do I share my code with others using GitHub?
- What is the minimal documentation required for others to be able to run my code?
- Writing a good README file
- Dealing with dependencies
- What makes code readable and reusable?
- Code conventions and modular coding

You will have hands-on exercises and many opportunities to ask questions that are relevant to you.

The workshop is a full day on location at the Netherlands eScience Center.
