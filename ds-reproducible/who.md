You are a researcher who wants to make your code reusable. You are able to write basic code in a programming language like R or Python. This can be a few simple lines of code or a larger piece of software.

The workshop is aimed at PhD candidates and other researchers or research software engineers affiliated with Dutch research institutions. We do not accept registrations by Master students.
