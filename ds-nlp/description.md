This lesson teaches the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in Python. It will equip you with the foundational skills and knowledge needed to carry over text-based research projects. The lesson is designed with researchers in the Humanities and Social Sciences in mind, but is also applicable to other fields of research.

On the first day we will dive into the importance of linguistic principles when dealing with text data, we will also teach basic techniques for text preprocessing and understand the principles behind word embeddings. The second day begins with an introduction to transformers, followed by hands-on work on classification tasks with the BERT model including basic evaluation techniques.  In the afternoon, we will cover large language language models, learn to work locally with open source models and understand potential drwbacks and biases when using this technology.
